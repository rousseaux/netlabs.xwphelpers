# makefile_dll:
#       makefile for src/helpers directory.
#
#       See "makefile" for remarks.
#
#       This is used with WarpIN for preparing the runtime
#       DLL which is shared between the WarpIN executables.
#
#       As opposed to "makefile", this does not create
#       helpers.lib, but only the objects files, which are
#       then linked with the other shared components into
#       the runtime DLL.
#
#       Edit "setup.in" to set up the make process.

# Say hello to yourself.
