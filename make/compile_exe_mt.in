#       include file for nmake that defines the inference
#       rule for compiling standalone object code from C files.
#       This has been put into this include file because
#       I finally got tired of changing this rule in a
#       dozen makefiles all the time.
#
#       !include this file only for code that will be in
#       a standalone EXE file. This uses the $(CC_EXE_MT)
#       compiler setup.
